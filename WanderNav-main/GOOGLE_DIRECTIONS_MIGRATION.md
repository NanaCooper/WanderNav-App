# Google Directions API Migration

## Overview
Successfully migrated WanderNav from OpenRouteService (OSRM) to Google Directions API for improved accuracy and better routing capabilities.

## Changes Made

### 1. API Service Updates (`src/services/api.ts`)
- **Added Google Directions API configuration**
  - API Key: `AIzaSyAYomIa3M4RB4IWf9j4vOXPGCczFu7ALus`
  - Base URL: `https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/directions/json`

- **Replaced `getRouteOpenRouteService()` with `getRouteGoogleDirections()`**
  - New function uses Google's Directions API
  - Converts Google's response format to match existing app expectations
  - Handles polyline decoding for route coordinates
  - Processes HTML instructions to plain text
  - Maintains backward compatibility with deprecated function

### 2. Search Screen Updates (`app/searchScreen.tsx`)
- **Updated import**: Changed from `getRouteOpenRouteService` to `getRouteGoogleDirections`
- **Updated function call**: Now uses Google Directions API
- **Updated logging**: Changed console messages to reflect Google API usage

### 3. Saved Destinations Screen Updates (`app/savedDestinationsScreen.tsx`)
- **Updated import**: Changed from `getRouteOpenRouteService` to `getRouteGoogleDirections`
- **Updated function call**: Now uses Google Directions API for saved destination routing

### 4. Map Screen Updates (`app/mapScreen.tsx`)
- **Updated waypoint routing**: Changed from OSRM to Google Directions API
- **Updated comments**: Changed OSRM references to Google API references
- **Updated URL construction**: Now uses Google's waypoints format

## Benefits of Google Directions API

### ✅ Improved Accuracy
- Better route calculation with real-time traffic consideration
- More accurate distance and duration estimates
- Better handling of complex road networks

### ✅ Enhanced Features
- Real-time traffic data (when available)
- Better turn-by-turn navigation instructions
- More detailed route alternatives
- Lane guidance for complex intersections

### ✅ Global Coverage
- Comprehensive road network coverage worldwide
- Better support for different transport modes
- More accurate in regions where OSRM had limited data

## API Usage
- **Cost**: Pay-per-use ($5 per 1000 requests)
- **Rate Limits**: 100 requests per 100 seconds per user
- **Quota**: 2,500 requests per day (free tier)

## Testing
✅ **API Test Passed**
- Successfully tested with sample coordinates in Kumasi, Ghana
- Route calculation working correctly
- Distance and duration calculations accurate
- Polyline decoding functioning properly

## Backward Compatibility
- Maintained deprecated `getRouteOpenRouteService()` function
- All existing functionality preserved
- No breaking changes to app interface

## Next Steps
1. **Monitor API Usage**: Track request volume to manage costs
2. **Error Handling**: Implement fallback to OSRM if Google API fails
3. **Caching**: Consider implementing route caching to reduce API calls
4. **Rate Limiting**: Implement client-side rate limiting to stay within quotas

## Files Modified
- `client/WanderNav/src/services/api.ts`
- `client/WanderNav/app/searchScreen.tsx`
- `client/WanderNav/app/savedDestinationsScreen.tsx`
- `client/WanderNav/app/mapScreen.tsx`

## Migration Status: ✅ COMPLETE
The WanderNav app now uses Google Directions API for improved routing accuracy while maintaining all existing functionality.
